## What is the tournament about?

We have created a video game that is designed to be played by a small python program, rather than a human.
Conference attendees can participate in a tournament where they (either alone or in a team) each submit a bot that will play the game, and at the end of the conference, we will have a tournament session where everyone can come and watch our strange creations play against each other (either brilliantly or it may all go wrong!).

## Disclaimer

The topic of the game is a sci-fi war on a foreign planet, set far in the future. We understand that the topic of war could upset some people with the unfortunate events that are currently going on in Ukraine. We do not want to promote war, and we fully support Ukraine in their hardship. Development of the game was started before the invasion of Ukraine, it is just a coincidence that this is the game that was ready for the conference.
We just want to make a fun event for EuroPython participants, we do not want to offend anyone.
